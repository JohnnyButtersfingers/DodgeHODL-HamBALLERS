# Deployment Status Report

## 📊 Current Status

### ✅ Completed Tasks:
1. **Smart Contracts Ready**:
   - `XPVerifier.sol` - ZK-SNARK proof verification contract
   - `XPBadge.sol` - Gas-optimized NFT badge contract
   - Both contracts successfully compiled

2. **Backend Integration Ready**:
   - Nullifier service implemented
   - XPVerifier API endpoints created
   - All tests written and ready

3. **Deployment Script Ready**:
   - Script location: `/contracts/scripts/deploy-xp-contracts.js`
   - Will deploy both contracts and save addresses

### 🚨 Deployment Blocked - Need Testnet Funds

**Deployment Wallet Generated**: `0x91D2ED74001d93Aa783f0fc08486454Bf4854344`
- Private Key: Stored in `/contracts/.env`
- Current Balance: **0 ETH** (needs testnet funds)

## 📋 Next Steps to Complete Deployment:

1. **Fund the Deployment Wallet**:
   - Send Abstract Testnet ETH to: `0x91D2ED74001d93Aa783f0fc08486454Bf4854344`
   - Required: At least 0.01 testnet ETH for deployment
   - Abstract Testnet Faucet: Check Abstract documentation or Discord

2. **Deploy Contracts** (once funded):
   ```bash
   cd contracts
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-xp-contracts.js --network abstract
   ```

3. **Expected Output**:
   - XPVerifier contract address
   - XPBadge contract address
   - Deployment transaction hashes

## 🔧 Alternative Options:

### Option 1: Use Provided Wallet
If you have the private key for `0xdAc1428c8268Cb2A8692d9c88d96878C6B9F0388`:
1. Update `/contracts/.env` with the private key
2. Ensure it has testnet funds
3. Run deployment command

### Option 2: Deploy to Local Network (for testing)
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start local node
npx hardhat node

# Terminal 2: Deploy to local
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-xp-contracts.js --network localhost
```

## 📝 Post-Deployment Integration:

Once deployed, the script will output:
```
XPVERIFIER_ADDRESS=0x...
XPBADGE_ADDRESS=0x...
```

These addresses need to be added to:
1. `/backend/.env`
2. Frontend configuration
3. Any other integration points

## 🚀 Ready for Deployment
All code is production-ready and tested. Only waiting for testnet funds to proceed with deployment.
