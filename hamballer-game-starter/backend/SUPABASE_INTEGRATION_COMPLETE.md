# ✅ HamBaller.xyz Supabase Integration Complete!

## 🎉 What We've Accomplished

The HamBaller.xyz backend now has **complete Supabase integration** with the following features implemented:

### ✅ 1. Environment Configuration
- **Centralized environment management** in `config/environment.js`
- **Proper variable naming** with `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` support
- **Validation helpers** for checking configuration status
- **Fallback support** for development and production environments

### ✅ 2. Database Integration
- **Enhanced database configuration** in `config/database.js`
- **Service role client** for administrative operations
- **Mock database fallback** for development without Supabase
- **Comprehensive error handling** and logging

### ✅ 3. XP Update Function
- **`db.updateXP()` function** specifically for RunCompleted events
- **Automatic level calculation** (every 100 XP = 1 level)
- **Player stats upsert** with conflict resolution
- **Event logging** to `event_logs` table
- **Detailed result tracking** with before/after values

### ✅ 4. RunCompleted Listener
- **Enhanced event listener** with detailed logging
- **Automatic XP persistence** when events are triggered
- **WebSocket broadcasting** for real-time updates
- **Error handling** with detailed error information
- **Periodic status logging** for monitoring

### ✅ 5. Health Check Endpoint
- **Enhanced `/health` route** with Supabase write verification
- **Automatic write testing** on each health check
- **Comprehensive system status** including memory usage
- **Proper HTTP status codes** (200 for healthy, 503 for unhealthy)

### ✅ 6. Testing Endpoints
- **`/api/test/xp-update`** for manual XP update testing
- **`/api/config/status`** for configuration verification
- **`/api/broadcast`** for WebSocket testing

## 🔧 Current Status

### ✅ Working Features
- Backend server starts successfully
- Health endpoint responds with detailed status
- XP update function works (in mock mode)
- RunCompleted listener is ready (when contracts are configured)
- WebSocket server is operational
- Environment configuration is centralized

### ⚠️ Pending Configuration
- **Supabase credentials** need to be set in `.env` file
- **Contract addresses** need to be deployed and configured
- **Database schema** needs to be imported to Supabase

## 📋 Next Steps to Complete Setup

### 1. Configure Supabase Credentials

Update `backend/.env` with your actual Supabase credentials:

```bash
# Replace these placeholder values with your actual credentials
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key_here
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key_here
```

### 2. Import Database Schema

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Copy the contents of `backend/database_schema.sql`
4. Paste and execute the SQL
5. Verify tables are created in **Table Editor**

### 3. Deploy Smart Contracts

```bash
cd contracts
npm install
npm run deploy:production
```

Copy the deployed contract addresses to your `.env` file:

```bash
DBP_TOKEN_ADDRESS=0x... # From deployment output
BOOST_NFT_ADDRESS=0x... # From deployment output
HODL_MANAGER_ADDRESS=0x... # From deployment output
```

### 4. Test Complete Integration

After configuring credentials:

```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl http://localhost:3001/health

# Test XP update with real database
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/test/xp-update \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "playerAddress": "0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890",
    "xpEarned": "150",
    "dbpEarned": "25",
    "runId": "test-run-123"
  }'
```

## 🧪 Testing the RunCompleted Listener

Once contracts are deployed, the RunCompleted listener will automatically:

1. **Listen for events** on the HODL Manager contract
2. **Log detailed information** when events are triggered:
   ```
   🏆 ===== RunCompleted Event Triggered =====
   👤 Player: 0x1234...
   ⭐ XP Earned: 150
   💰 DBP Earned: 25
   🎮 Run ID: 123
   ⏰ Timestamp: 2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z
   ==========================================
   ```

3. **Update player stats** in Supabase database
4. **Broadcast updates** to connected WebSocket clients
5. **Log results** with before/after values

## 📊 Monitoring and Debugging

### Health Check Response
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "supabase": {
    "configured": true,
    "writeTest": {
      "success": true,
      "message": "Supabase write test successful"
    },
    "connection": "working"
  },
  "configuration": {
    "supabase": true,
    "blockchain": true,
    "contracts": true
  }
}
```

### Configuration Status
```json
{
  "supabase": {
    "configured": true,
    "url": "Set",
    "hasKey": true,
    "hasServiceKey": true
  },
  "contracts": {
    "configured": true,
    "hodlManager": "Set"
  }
}
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Supabase Connection Failed**
   - Verify URL and keys are correct
   - Check if database schema is imported
   - Ensure RLS policies are configured

2. **Contract Listener Not Starting**
   - Verify contract addresses are set
   - Check RPC URL is accessible
   - Ensure contracts are deployed to correct network

3. **XP Updates Not Persisting**
   - Check Supabase write permissions
   - Verify service role key has proper access
   - Check event logs for errors

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check configuration status
curl http://localhost:3001/api/config/status

# Test Supabase write
curl http://localhost:3001/health

# Test XP update manually
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/test/xp-update \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"playerAddress":"0x1234...","xpEarned":"100","dbpEarned":"10","runId":"test"}'
```

## 🚀 Production Deployment

For production deployment:

1. **Set environment variables** in your hosting platform
2. **Update CORS origins** to your production domain
3. **Configure production Supabase** project
4. **Deploy contracts** to mainnet
5. **Update frontend** to point to production backend

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the backend logs for detailed error messages
2. Verify all environment variables are set correctly
3. Test each component individually using the provided endpoints
4. Refer to `ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md` for detailed setup instructions
