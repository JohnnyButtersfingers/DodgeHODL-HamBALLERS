# Phase 5 Integration Status - HamBaller.xyz

## ✅ COMPLETED

### 1. Backend Integration
- ✅ **HODLManager contract address added to `.env`** - Backend now recognizes deployed contract
- ✅ **Real RunCompleted listener enabled** - Listener active when blockchain and contracts are configured
- ✅ **XP verification route added** - `/api/xp/:wallet` endpoint returns player stats from Supabase
- ✅ **Mock RunCompleted event emitter** - `scripts/emit-run-completed.js` for testing XP persistence
- ✅ **Enhanced health check** - `/health` endpoint verifies Supabase connectivity and contract status

### 2. Frontend Integration
- ✅ **GameSummary enhanced** - Now displays real-time XP, level, and wallet address
- ✅ **RunProgress enhanced** - Shows live XP updates during game runs
- ✅ **Contract integration ready** - `useContracts()` hook configured for on-chain interactions
- ✅ **WebSocket integration** - Real-time XP updates via WebSocket connections
- ✅ **Environment setup script** - `frontend/setup-env.js` for easy configuration

### 3. XP System
- ✅ **XP persistence** - Backend stores XP in Supabase via `updateXP()` function
- ✅ **Real-time updates** - WebSocket broadcasts XP rewards to connected clients
- ✅ **Level calculation** - Automatic level progression based on XP earned
- ✅ **Event logging** - All XP rewards logged to `event_logs` table

## 🔄 CURRENT STATUS

### Backend Status
```
📡 Server: Running on http://0.0.0.0:3001
🗄️ Supabase: Configured (using mock data until credentials added)
⛓️ Blockchain: Configured (Abstract testnet)
📜 Contracts: HODLManager address set
🎧 RunCompleted Listener: Active and listening
```

### Frontend Status
```
🎮 GameView: Ready for on-chain integration
⭐ XP Display: Real-time updates implemented
🔌 WebSocket: Connected for live updates
📜 Contracts: Ready for deployment addresses
```

## 📋 NEXT STEPS

### 1. Contract Deployment (Required)
```bash
cd contracts
# Ensure you have testnet ETH
./quick-check.sh
# Deploy contracts
npm run deploy:production
```

### 2. Environment Configuration
```bash
# Backend - Update with real Supabase credentials
# Edit backend/.env:
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key_here
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key_here

# Frontend - Update with contract addresses
cd frontend
node setup-env.js
# Edit frontend/.env with deployed contract addresses:
VITE_HODL_MANAGER_ADDRESS=0xYourDeployedAddress
VITE_DBP_TOKEN_ADDRESS=0xYourDeployedAddress
VITE_BOOST_NFT_ADDRESS=0xYourDeployedAddress
```

### 3. Testing Integration
```bash
# Test XP persistence
curl http://localhost:3001/api/xp/0xYourWalletAddress

# Test mock event emission
node scripts/emit-run-completed.js single 0xYourWalletAddress 200 30

# Test frontend with real contracts
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### 4. Frontend On-Chain Integration
- **GameView** will automatically use `useContracts()` when addresses are configured
- **startRun()** and **endRun()** will trigger on-chain transactions
- **Real-time XP updates** will display during and after runs
- **WebSocket integration** will show live updates from blockchain events

## 🧪 TESTING CHECKLIST

### Backend Tests
- [ ] `/health` returns 200 with Supabase connected
- [ ] `/api/xp/:wallet` returns player stats
- [ ] Mock event emitter updates XP correctly
- [ ] RunCompleted listener processes real events
- [ ] WebSocket broadcasts XP updates

### Frontend Tests
- [ ] GameSummary shows current XP and level
- [ ] RunProgress displays real-time XP during runs
- [ ] Contract integration works with deployed addresses
- [ ] WebSocket receives live XP updates
- [ ] GameView triggers on-chain startRun/endRun

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Complete game run triggers on-chain events
- [ ] XP updates persist in Supabase
- [ ] Frontend displays updated XP immediately
- [ ] WebSocket broadcasts work across multiple clients

## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Common Issues
1. **Supabase not configured** - Add real credentials to `backend/.env`
2. **Contracts not deployed** - Deploy contracts and update addresses
3. **WebSocket not connecting** - Check backend is running on port 3001
4. **XP not updating** - Verify RunCompleted listener is active
5. **Frontend build errors** - Check contract addresses in `frontend/.env`

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check backend status
curl http://localhost:3001/health

# Check XP for wallet
curl http://localhost:3001/api/xp/0xYourWalletAddress

# Test mock event
node scripts/emit-run-completed.js single 0xYourWalletAddress 100 15

# Check frontend build
cd frontend && npm run build
```

## 🎯 SUCCESS CRITERIA

Phase 5 is complete when:
- [ ] Contracts deployed and addresses configured
- [ ] Supabase credentials added and working
- [ ] Frontend displays real-time XP updates
- [ ] Game runs trigger on-chain transactions
- [ ] XP persistence verified in database
- [ ] WebSocket live updates working
- [ ] End-to-end game flow functional
