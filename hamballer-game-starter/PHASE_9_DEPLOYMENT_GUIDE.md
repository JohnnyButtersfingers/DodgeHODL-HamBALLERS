## 🔍 Verification Steps

### 1. Check Contract Deployment

```bash
# Verify on Explorer
open https://explorer.testnet.abs.xyz/address/YOUR_XPVERIFIER_ADDRESS

# Check contract state
cd contracts
npx hardhat console --network abstract
> const xpVerifier = await ethers.getContractAt("XPVerifier", "YOUR_ADDRESS")
> await xpVerifier.getThreshold()
100n
```

### 2. Test Gas Usage

```bash
# Run with gas reporting
cd contracts
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test

# Check gas-report.txt
cat gas-report.txt
```

**Expected Gas Report:**
```

```

### 3. Monitor Error Logs

```bash
# Backend logs
tail -f backend/logs/error.log

# Frontend console
# Open browser DevTools > Console
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. RPC Timeout Errors

**Error:**
```
FetchError: request to https://api.testnet.abs.xyz failed, reason: connect ETIMEDOUT
```

**Solution:**
```bash
# Use fallback RPC in .env
ABSTRACT_TESTNET_RPC=https://rpc.abstract.xyz
```

#### 2. Insufficient Gas

**Error:**
```
Error: insufficient funds for gas * price + value
```

**Solution:**
```bash
# Get testnet ETH from faucet
open https://faucet.testnet.abs.xyz

# Check balance
node contracts/scripts/check-balance.js
```

#### 3. Nullifier Already Used

**Error:**
```
Error: Nullifier already used - replay attack prevented
```

**Solution:**
- This is expected behavior for replay prevention
- User needs to generate a new proof for a different badge

#### 4. Frontend Connection Issues

**Error:**
```
Error: Could not detect network
```

**Solution:**
1. Check MetaMask is on Abstract Testnet
2. Clear browser cache
3. Restart frontend dev server

## 📊 Production Readiness

### Mainnet Configuration

```javascript
// Update hardhat.config.js network
abstractMainnet: {
  url: "https://api.mainnet.abs.xyz",
  chainId: 2741,
  accounts: [process.env.MAINNET_PRIVATE_KEY]
}
```

### Deploy to Mainnet

```bash
# Deploy contracts
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy_xpverifier.js --network abstractMainnet

# Verify contracts
npx hardhat verify --network abstractMainnet DEPLOYED_ADDRESS
```
