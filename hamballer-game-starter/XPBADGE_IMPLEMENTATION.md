# XPBadge NFT Minting Implementation

## 📋 Overview

Added comprehensive XPBadge NFT minting support to the HamBaller.xyz backend, automatically rewarding players with NFT badges based on their XP performance in completed runs.

## ✅ Implementation Summary

### 🎫 Core Features Implemented

1. **Automatic Badge Minting**
   - Listens to `RunCompleted` events from HODLManager contract
   - Calculates badge tier based on XP earned in single run
   - Mints appropriate XPBadge NFT to player's wallet
   - Updates Supabase database with badge information

2. **Badge Tier System**
   - **Participation Badge (ID: 0)**: 1-24 XP earned
   - **Common Badge (ID: 1)**: 25-49 XP earned  
   - **Rare Badge (ID: 2)**: 50-74 XP earned
   - **Epic Badge (ID: 3)**: 75-99 XP earned
   - **Legendary Badge (ID: 4)**: 100+ XP earned

3. **Robust Transaction Handling**
   - Sequential minting queue to avoid nonce conflicts
   - Gas estimation and price monitoring
   - Transaction confirmation tracking (2 block confirmations)
   - Comprehensive error handling and logging

4. **Database Integration**
   - Seamless integration with existing Supabase XP pipeline
   - New columns in `run_logs` table for badge tracking
   - Analytics view for badge statistics per player

## 📁 Files Modified/Created

### Modified Files
- `backend/listeners/runCompletedListener.js` - Complete rewrite with XPBadge functionality
- `backend/database_schema.sql` - Added XPBadge columns to run_logs table  
- `backend/README.md` - Added comprehensive XPBadge documentation

### New Files
- `backend/.env.example` - Environment variable documentation
- `backend/migrations/add_xpbadge_columns.sql` - Database migration script
- `backend/test-xpbadge.js` - Comprehensive testing script

## 🔧 Configuration Required

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Required for XPBadge functionality
XPBADGE_ADDRESS=0x...  # XPBadge contract address
XPBADGE_MINTER_PRIVATE_KEY=0x...  # Wallet with MINTER_ROLE
```

### Database Migration
Run the migration script in Supabase SQL editor:
```sql
-- See: backend/migrations/add_xpbadge_columns.sql
ALTER TABLE run_logs 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS xp_badge_token_id INTEGER,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS xp_badge_tx_hash VARCHAR(66),
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS xp_badge_minted_at TIMESTAMPTZ;
```

### XPBadge Contract Requirements
The wallet specified in `XPBADGE_MINTER_PRIVATE_KEY` must have `MINTER_ROLE` on the XPBadge contract:
```solidity
// Grant minting permissions
xpBadgeContract.grantRole(MINTER_ROLE, minterWalletAddress);
```

## 🔄 Process Flow

1. **RunCompleted Event**: HODLManager emits event with player address, XP earned, and other data
2. **XP Calculation**: Uses existing `calculateXPReward()` function from runLogger.js
3. **Badge Tier Determination**: `generateBadgeTokenId()` maps XP to appropriate badge tier (0-4)
4. **Minting Queue**: Transaction added to sequential queue to prevent nonce conflicts
5. **Badge Minting**: `xpBadge.mintBadge(player, tokenId, xp, season)` called with gas estimation
6. **Database Update**: Supabase updated with tokenId, transaction hash, and timestamp
7. **Error Handling**: Failed mints logged but don't block run completion processing

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Script Usage
```bash
# Test all functionality
node backend/test-xpbadge.js

# Test with specific address
node backend/test-xpbadge.js --address=0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b8D5c3Ba4F8b0A87F6

# Skip actual minting (setup tests only)
node backend/test-xpbadge.js --skip-mint
```

### Test Coverage
- ✅ Environment variable validation
- ✅ Network connectivity testing
- ✅ Minter role permission verification
- ✅ Badge tier calculation testing
- ✅ End-to-end minting test
- ✅ Balance verification after minting

## 📊 Database Schema Updates

### New Columns in `run_logs`
```sql
xp_badge_token_id INTEGER,           -- Badge tier (0-4)
xp_badge_tx_hash VARCHAR(66),        -- Mint transaction hash
xp_badge_minted_at TIMESTAMPTZ       -- Mint timestamp
```

### Analytics View
```sql
-- Query player badge statistics
SELECT * FROM xp_badge_summary WHERE player_address = '0x...';

-- Returns:
-- total_badges_earned, participation_badges, common_badges, 
-- rare_badges, epic_badges, legendary_badges,
-- first_badge_earned, latest_badge_earned
```

## 🚨 Error Handling

### Graceful Fallbacks
- XPBadge contract unavailable → Continue normal run processing
- Minter wallet lacks permissions → Log error, continue operation  
- Insufficient gas/funds → Queue for retry, log detailed error
- Network connectivity issues → Retry with exponential backoff

### Logging & Monitoring
- Real-time minting attempt logging with detailed status
- Gas price monitoring and transaction cost tracking
- Queue status and processing metrics
- Failed transaction analysis with error codes and reasons

## 🔗 Integration Points

### Existing XP Pipeline
- Reuses `handleRunCompletion()` from runLogger.js
- Preserves all existing XP calculation and broadcasting logic
- Adds badge minting as additional step after XP processing

### Supabase Integration
- Uses existing database connection from config/database.js
- Updates run_logs table with badge information
- Maintains referential integrity with existing data

### WebSocket Broadcasting
- Badge mint status could be added to existing live update system
- Integration point available in runLogger.js broadcast functions

## 📈 Performance Considerations

### Sequential Minting Queue
- Prevents nonce conflicts from simultaneous transactions
- 2-second delay between mints to avoid overwhelming network
- Queue processing continues in background without blocking run completion

### Gas Optimization
- Gas estimation before each transaction
- Configurable gas buffer (50,000 units) for transaction safety
- Real-time gas price monitoring and adjustment

### Database Efficiency
- Indexed badge columns for fast queries
- Minimal additional database writes (3 columns per mint)
- Analytics view pre-computed for dashboard performance

## 🚀 Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Deploy XPBadge contract with appropriate roles
- [ ] Grant MINTER_ROLE to backend wallet
- [ ] Add environment variables to production environment
- [ ] Run database migration script in Supabase
- [ ] Test minting functionality with test script
- [ ] Monitor initial badge mints for proper operation

## 📝 Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
- Batch minting for multiple players to reduce gas costs
- Retry mechanism for failed mints with exponential backoff
- Badge rarity adjustments based on seasonal performance
- WebSocket real-time badge mint notifications to frontend
- Badge marketplace integration for trading/selling

### Analytics Opportunities
- Player badge progression tracking
- Seasonal badge distribution analysis
- XP-to-badge conversion rate optimization
- Badge tier balancing based on player feedback
