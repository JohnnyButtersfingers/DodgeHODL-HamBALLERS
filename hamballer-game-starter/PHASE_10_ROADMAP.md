### 5. User Experience Improvements

#### Performance Optimizations
- [ ] Implement proof pre-generation for eligible users
- [ ] Add progressive web app (PWA) support
- [ ] Optimize bundle size (<200KB gzipped)
- [ ] Implement lazy loading for components

#### Error Handling
- [ ] User-friendly error messages
- [ ] Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- [ ] Offline support with queue persistence
- [ ] Clear status indicators for all operations

### 6. Documentation & Support

#### Developer Documentation
- [ ] Complete API documentation with examples
- [ ] Smart contract integration guide
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Performance optimization tips

#### User Support
- [ ] FAQ section for common issues
- [ ] Discord support channel
- [ ] Video tutorials for badge claiming
- [ ] Status page for system health

## Success Criteria

### Technical Metrics
- ✅ Gas usage consistently under 285k
- ✅ 99.9% uptime SLA
- ✅ <5s proof generation time
- ✅ Zero critical security vulnerabilities

### Business Metrics
- ✅ 10,000+ badges claimed in first month
- ✅ 5,000+ unique users
- ✅ <1% error rate on claims
- ✅ 90%+ user satisfaction score

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Network Congestion**
   - Mitigation: Dynamic gas pricing, batch processing
   
2. **Scaling Bottlenecks**
   - Mitigation: Auto-scaling infrastructure, caching

3. **Smart Contract Bugs**
   - Mitigation: Extensive testing, gradual rollout

### Operational Risks
1. **Support Overload**
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive docs, automated responses

2. **Cost Overruns**
   - Mitigation: Usage caps, cost monitoring alerts

## Budget Estimation

### One-Time Costs
- Security Audit: $15,000-25,000
- Infrastructure Setup: $5,000
- Documentation/Design: $3,000

### Monthly Recurring
- Infrastructure: $2,000-5,000
- Monitoring Tools: $500-1,000
- Support Staff: $3,000-5,000
