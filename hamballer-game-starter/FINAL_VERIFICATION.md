- `player_achievements` - Player achievement tracking

### 5. ✅ Blockchain Integration Framework

**Implementation Completed:**
- ✅ Smart contract integration layer in `xpStoreV2.js`
- ✅ XP verification from on-chain data
- ✅ Event-based synchronization capabilities
- ✅ Error handling and fallback mechanisms
- ✅ Flexible ABI configuration for contract calls
