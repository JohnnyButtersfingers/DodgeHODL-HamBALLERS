# Deployment & Offline Development Improvements

## üìã Completion Checklist

### ‚úÖ Task 1: Populate contracts.json after deployment
- **Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- **Changes Made**:
  - Modified `contracts/scripts/deploy_all.js` to automatically export contract data
  - Added `exportContractsToFrontend()` function that writes to `frontend/src/config/contracts.json`
  - Created TypeScript definitions file `contracts.d.ts` for better development experience
  - Added `contractLoader.js` utility for easy contract data access in frontend

**Files Modified**:
- `contracts/scripts/deploy_all.js` - Added automatic export functionality
- `frontend/src/config/contractLoader.js` - New utility for loading contract data

**How it works**:
After running `pnpm deploy:contracts`, the script will automatically:
1. Export contract addresses and full ABIs to `frontend/src/config/contracts.json`
2. Generate TypeScript definitions in `contracts.d.ts`
3. Include network information and deployment timestamp

### ‚úÖ Task 2: Offline compiler configuration
- **Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- **Changes Made**:
  - Added `process.env.HARDHAT_COMPILERS_DOWNLOAD = 'false';` to `contracts/hardhat.config.js`
  - This prevents automatic Solidity compiler downloads in offline environments

**Files Modified**:
- `contracts/hardhat.config.js` - Added offline compiler setting

### ‚úÖ Task 3: Update README.md offline instructions
- **Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- **Changes Made**:
  - Added comprehensive "Offline Development" section to `README.md`
  - Documented both `pnpm store export` method and manual store copy fallback
  - Clarified that `pnpm store export` may not work in pnpm v10+
  - Provided step-by-step instructions for offline environment setup

**Files Modified**:
- `README.md` - Added detailed offline development section

## üöÄ Usage Instructions

### After Deployment
Run the deployment script as usual:
```bash
cd contracts
pnpm deploy:contracts
```

The script will now automatically create:
- `frontend/src/config/contracts.json` - Full contract data with ABIs
- `frontend/src/config/contracts.d.ts` - TypeScript definitions

### Using Contracts in Frontend
```javascript
import { loadContracts, getContract, areContractsDeployed } from '../config/contractLoader.js';

// Load all contract data
const contracts = await loadContracts();

// Get specific contract
const dbpToken = await getContract('DBPToken');

// Check if contracts are deployed
const deployed = await areContractsDeployed();
```

### Offline Development Setup
1. **On machine with internet**:
   ```bash
   pnpm install:all
   pnpm store path
   cp -r $(pnpm store path)/* ./scripts/pnpm-store/
   ```

2. **On offline machine**:
   ```bash
   export PNPM_STORE_DIR="./scripts/pnpm-store"
   pnpm install:all --offline
   ```

## üîç Technical Details

### Contract Export Process
1. Deployment script deploys all contracts
2. `exportContractsToFrontend()` function extracts:
   - Contract addresses
   - Full ABI data using `contract.interface.fragments`
   - Network information (name, chainId)
   - Deployment timestamp
3. Data is written to structured JSON file for frontend consumption

### Offline Compiler Benefits
- Prevents network requests during compilation
- Ensures reproducible builds in air-gapped environments
- Reduces deployment time by skipping unnecessary downloads

### Fallback Strategy
The `contractLoader.js` utility provides graceful fallback:
1. First tries to load `contracts.json` (post-deployment)
2. Falls back to environment variables and simplified ABIs if file not found
3. Provides consistent API regardless of deployment state

## üìù Branch Information
