## 🎯 Next Steps

### 1. Backend Configuration
Update backend environment with:
```bash
XPBADGE_ADDRESS=0xE960B46dffd9de6187Ff1B48B31B3F186A07303b
XPVERIFIER_ADDRESS=0x5e33911d9c793e5E9172D9e5C4354e21350403E3
XPBADGE_MINTER_PRIVATE_KEY=<backend_minter_private_key>
```

### 2. Frontend Integration
The frontend will automatically use the contract addresses from the environment variables.

### 3. Test Badge Minting
Create a test script to verify badge minting works:
```bash
cd contracts
npx hardhat run scripts/test-badge-minting.js --network abstract
```

### 4. Phase 8 Claim System
The claim system is now ready to use the deployed contracts:
- `/claim` route is configured
