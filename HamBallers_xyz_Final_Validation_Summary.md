- `./deploy-frontend.sh` for frontend deployment
- `./deploy-backend.sh` for backend services
- Contract deployment via hardhat scripts

### 3. Post-Deployment Validation
Once deployed, conduct comprehensive testing of:
- Wallet connectivity across different providers
- Game functionality and mechanics
- Responsive design on various devices
- Performance and loading times
- Smart contract interactions
