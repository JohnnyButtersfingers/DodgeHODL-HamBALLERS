# Vercel Deployment Fix - Final Resolution

## Issue Summary
The site https://dodge-hodl-ham-ballers.vercel.app was returning 404: NOT_FOUND due to incorrect build configuration for the frontend subdirectory structure.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Conflicting vercel.json files**: There were two vercel.json files - one at the root and one in the frontend directory, causing configuration conflicts
2. **Incorrect framework specification**: The root vercel.json had `framework: null` instead of `framework: "vite"`
3. **Missing explicit Vite configuration**: Vercel needed explicit configuration to understand this is a Vite/React project

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated Root vercel.json
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "cd hamballer-game-starter/frontend && npm install && npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "hamballer-game-starter/frontend/dist",
  "installCommand": "cd hamballer-game-starter/frontend && npm install",
  "framework": "vite",
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ],
  "functions": {
    "api/**/*.js": {
      "maxDuration": 30
    }
  },
  "regions": ["iad1"]
}
```

### 2. Removed Conflicting Frontend vercel.json
- Deleted `hamballer-game-starter/frontend/vercel.json` to avoid configuration conflicts

### 3. Verified Build Output
- Confirmed the frontend builds successfully with `npm run build`
- Build output is correctly placed in `hamballer-game-starter/frontend/dist/`
- All assets are properly generated with correct paths

## Large Log Issue
The large build logs (>4MB) are due to Vite outputting information for all 2085 modules during the build process. This is normal for a project with many dependencies (RainbowKit, ThirdWeb, etc.). The build itself completes successfully in about 79 lines of output.

## Deployment Instructions

1. **Push Changes**: The updated configuration has been pushed to the repository
2. **Vercel Auto-Deploy**: Vercel should automatically trigger a new deployment
3. **Manual Trigger** (if needed): Go to Vercel Dashboard → Project → Deployments → Redeploy

## Environment Variables Required
The following environment variables should be set in Vercel Dashboard:
- `VITE_API_URL` (for production API endpoint)
- `VITE_WS_URL` (for WebSocket endpoint)
- `VITE_DBP_TOKEN_ADDRESS` (contract address)
- `VITE_BOOST_NFT_ADDRESS` (contract address)
- `VITE_HODL_MANAGER_ADDRESS` (contract address)
- `VITE_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID` (from WalletConnect)

## Verification Steps
1. Check deployment logs in Vercel Dashboard
2. Verify build completes with "Ready" status
3. Visit https://dodge-hodl-ham-ballers.vercel.app to confirm the site loads

## Status
✅ Root vercel.json properly configured for Vite/React in subdirectory
✅ Conflicting frontend vercel.json removed
✅ Build configuration verified locally
✅ Changes committed and pushed to repository
✅ Ready for Vercel to redeploy

The deployment should now work correctly with these fixes applied.
